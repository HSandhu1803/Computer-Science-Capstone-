#### Professional Self-Assessment
Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has been a transformative journey, allowing me to showcase my strengths, refine my professional goals, and prepare for a successful career in the computer science field. This process has not only deepened my technical expertise but also enhanced my ability to collaborate, communicate, and adapt to new challenges in a rapidly evolving industry.

Throughout the program, I have developed a strong foundation in key areas such as software design, data structures, algorithms, and database management. These skills have been crucial in shaping my professional goals, particularly my enthusiasm for software development, data structures, and algorithm design. For example, in my CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms course, I created a course planner program using C++. This project required me to load and organize course data efficiently, honing my problem-solving abilities and solidifying my interest in creating optimized software solutions.

The math courses I took were instrumental in developing my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. These skills are essential in computer science, especially in tasks like algorithm design, optimization, and data analysis. This analytical mindset has been a driving force in my ability to tackle complex problems and find innovative solutions, which is a critical aspect of my career aspirations. Collaboration has been a significant part of my learning experience. In team projects, I have had the opportunity to work with peers to design, develop, and test software applications. One notable project from IT 140: Introduction to Scripting involved creating a Zombie text-based game using Python. This project not only enhanced my software design skills but also emphasized the importance of teamwork and communication, as we worked together to ensure the game met our design goals and provided an engaging user experience.

Moreover, the Emerging Trends course helped me stay updated with the latest technologies, tools, and methodologies, which is crucial for staying relevant in the fast-paced tech industry. This course sparked my interest in emerging fields like artificial intelligence and mobile application development, aligning with my career goals and ensuring that I remain adaptable and innovative in my work. Ethical considerations have been a consistent theme throughout my education. I have learned the importance of maintaining integrity, accountability, and high standards in all aspects of my work. This is particularly evident in my database analysis report from DAD 220: Introduction to Structured Database Environments, where I focused on ensuring the accuracy and security of data within the Companies database. I am committed to upholding ethical standards in my professional life, prioritizing the creation of secure, reliable, and efficient solutions.
