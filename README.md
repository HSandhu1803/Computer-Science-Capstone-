#### Professional Self-Assessment
Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has been a transformative journey, allowing me to showcase my strengths, refine my professional goals, and prepare for a successful career in the computer science field. This process has not only deepened my technical expertise but also enhanced my ability to collaborate, communicate, and adapt to new challenges in a rapidly evolving industry.

Throughout the program, I have developed a strong foundation in key areas such as software design, data structures, algorithms, and database management. These skills have been crucial in shaping my professional goals, particularly my enthusiasm for software development, data structures, and algorithm design. For example, in my CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms course, I created a course planner program using C++. This project required me to load and organize course data efficiently, honing my problem-solving abilities and solidifying my interest in creating optimized software solutions.

The math courses I took were instrumental in developing my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. These skills are essential in computer science, especially in tasks like algorithm design, optimization, and data analysis. This analytical mindset has been a driving force in my ability to tackle complex problems and find innovative solutions, which is a critical aspect of my career aspirations. Collaboration has been a significant part of my learning experience. In team projects, I have had the opportunity to work with peers to design, develop, and test software applications. One notable project from IT 140: Introduction to Scripting involved creating a Zombie text-based game using Python. This project not only enhanced my software design skills but also emphasized the importance of teamwork and communication, as we worked together to ensure the game met our design goals and provided an engaging user experience.

Moreover, the Emerging Trends course helped me stay updated with the latest technologies, tools, and methodologies, which is crucial for staying relevant in the fast-paced tech industry. This course sparked my interest in emerging fields like artificial intelligence and mobile application development, aligning with my career goals and ensuring that I remain adaptable and innovative in my work. Ethical considerations have been a consistent theme throughout my education. I have learned the importance of maintaining integrity, accountability, and high standards in all aspects of my work. This is particularly evident in my database analysis report from DAD 220: Introduction to Structured Database Environments, where I focused on ensuring the accuracy and security of data within the Companies database. I am committed to upholding ethical standards in my professional life, prioritizing the creation of secure, reliable, and efficient solutions.


##### CODE REVIEW: 
* üé• My code review video: [Watch it here](https://youtu.be/SuOvxwoVJQo?si=Y9nSh4-JIeFyQ5w2!)

[Enhancement Plan One](Enhancement-1/)
The artifact is a **text-based adventure game** titled _"Deadly Zombie Adventure Game"_, created during the IT 140: Introduction to Scripting course. The game involves navigating through created as part of the course project to demonstrate basic scripting skills using Python. I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it represents my foundational skills in programming and demonstrates my ability to create an interactive application from scratch by building a story board/map of a game, visualising flow of a code by creating pseudocode and finally coded it using Python.
The artifact was improved by:
1.	Adding New Rooms and Items: Introduced "Library," "Cafeteria," and "Emergency Exit" rooms, along with new items like "Magic Potion," "Key-card," and "Night Vision Goggles."
2.	Enhanced Game Logic: Implemented puzzles that need to be solved to access certain rooms or items and introduced multiple endings based on the items collected and decisions made.

[Enhancement Plan Two](Enhancement-2/)
The artifact I chose for Category Two is **‚ÄúCourse planner program‚Äù** from the CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms course at Southern New Hampshire University. This program loads course data from a file, organizes it using an unordered map, and allows users to view course information and prerequisites. The original purpose of the artifact was to demonstrate the ability to implement and manipulate data structures, specifically focusing on efficient data storage and retrieval using C++. The artifact was created during the course, showcasing my progress in understanding and applying data structures. I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it not only demonstrates my proficiency in implementing and manipulating complex data structures but also showcases my ability to enhance existing code to improve functionality and user experience. 
The artifact was improved by:
1.	Linked List Addition: The primary enhancement was the addition of a linked list data structure. It allows dynamic insertion and deletion of courses, which was not possible with the unordered map alone.
2.	Inserting and Removing Courses: I added options for users to insert and remove courses from the linked list. This required implementing methods for appending, prepending, and removing nodes in the linked list.
3.	Improved User Interface: The menu was expanded to include options for adding and removing courses. This improvement involved designing a user-friendly interface that guides the user through the process of managing the course data.

[Enhancement Plan Three](Enhancement-3/)
The artifact is a **database analysis report** based on the _Companies database_. It was created as part of the DAD 220: Introduction to Structured Database Environments course. The assignment involved analyzing data from various tables within the database, such as Collaborator, Orders, and RMA, and generating reports based on specific queries. The artifact includes SQL commands for data retrieval and analysis, focusing on descriptive analysis and aggregation of data. I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my proficiency in database management, data retrieval, and analysis, which are critical skills in software development. 
The artifact was improved by:
1. Introducing advanced concepts such as data mining and visualization.
2. The enhancement involved creating a MongoDB interface to store and analyze data, using the MongoDB Aggregation Framework to perform complex data analysis, and ensuring regular software updates and access controls to maintain data security.
