            <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program and developing my ePortfolio has been a transformative 
                journey, allowing me to showcase my strengths, refine my professional goals, and prepare for a successful career in the 
                computer science field. This process has not only deepened my technical expertise but also enhanced my ability to 
                collaborate, communicate, and adapt to new challenges in a rapidly evolving industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the course, I have developed a strong foundation in key areas such as software design, data structures, 
                algorithms, and database management. These skills have been crucial in shaping my professional goals, particularly my 
                enthusiasm for software development, data structures, and algorithm design. For example, in my CS 300: Data Structures 
                and Algorithms course, I created a course planner program using C++. This project required me to load and organize course 
                data efficiently, honing my problem-solving abilities and solidifying my interest in creating optimized software solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The math courses I took were instrumental in developing my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills. These skills 
                are essential in computer science, especially in tasks like algorithm design, optimization, and data analysis. This 
                analytical mindset has been a driving force in my ability to tackle complex problems and find innovative solutions, which 
                is a critical aspect of my career aspirations. Collaboration has been a significant part of my learning experience. In 
                team projects, I have had the opportunity to work with peers to design, develop, and test software applications. One 
                notable project from IT 140: Introduction to Scripting involved creating a Zombie text-based game using Python. This 
                project not only enhanced my software design skills but also emphasized the importance of teamwork and communication, as 
                we worked together to ensure the game met our design goals and provided an engaging user experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Moreover, the Emerging Trends course helped me stay updated with the latest technologies, tools, and methodologies, which 
                is crucial for staying relevant in the fast-paced tech industry. This course sparked my interest in emerging fields like 
                artificial intelligence and mobile application development, aligning with my career goals and ensuring that I remain 
                adaptable and innovative in my work. Ethical considerations have been a consistent theme throughout my education. I have 
                learned the importance of maintaining integrity, accountability, and high standards in all aspects of my work. This is 
                particularly evident in my database analysis report from DAD 220: Introduction to Structured Database Environments, where 
                I focused on ensuring the accuracy and security of data within the Companies database. I am committed to upholding ethical 
                standards in my professional life, prioritizing the creation of secure, reliable, and efficient solutions.

                Throughout the course, I have achieved all five course outcomes across different enhancements and code review. During 
                the creation of my code review video, I successfully achieved the course outcome of designing, developing, and delivering 
                professional-quality communications.  In Enhancement-1 (Software Engineering and Design), I effectively employed 
                strategies for building collaborative environments by integrating diverse feedback into the text-based adventure game, 
                while also creating professional, coherent, and audience-appropriate documentation. Additionally, I designed and evaluated 
                algorithmic solutions, managing trade-offs in data structures and algorithms, and implemented innovative, value-driven 
                solutions using industry-standard practices in my Python code. In Enhancement-2 (Data Structures and Algorithms), I 
                demonstrated my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using advanced data structures like linked lists and 
                unordered maps, and showcased innovative techniques and tools to develop robust software solutions. Furthermore, I 
                delivered professional-quality written communications by improving code readability and organization. Finally, in 
                Enhancement-3 (Databases), I developed a security mindset by implementing regular updates and access controls, ensuring 
                data privacy and security, and used innovative techniques with MongoDB to manage and analyse data effectively, 
                demonstrating my skills in delivering value through computing practices.
